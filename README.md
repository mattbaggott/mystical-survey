Analysis of a very brief survey of mystical experiences in the adult Internet-using U.S. population

##Abstract
Many people report having had mystical-religious experiences. The prevalence of these experiences has increased over time, which suggests changing cultural factors may contribute the experience. I conducted an online survey of 6,209 adults to determine how common different activities, including drug use, were before the onset of a mystical-religious experience.  19.6% (1,045) reported having had a mystical-religious experience and were asked a follow-up question on their activities before the experience.  The most commonly endorsed pre-onset activity categories were: Prayer, meditation, or contemplation (37.2%); Being outdoors in nature (19.6%); and Religious ceremony, practice, or ritual (16.1%). Less commonly, respondents reported fasting (5.7%) or drug use (4.7%). A large percent (35.2%) reported not engaging in any of these activities before their experiences. Psychoactive drugs and nature are precedents to mystical-religious experience that are not selectively associated with traditional religious institutions and deserve additional study.

##Key take aways
About 8 in 1,000 Internet-using adults in the United States have had mystical-religious experiences after drug use.
About 33 in 1,000 have had mystical-religious experiences associated with being outdoors in nature.  
The relationships between these activities, which are not selectively associated with traditional religious institutions, and mystical-religious experiences deserves further study.
